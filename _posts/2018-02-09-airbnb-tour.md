### Where
- 888 Brannan St, San Francisco, CA 94103

### When
- Fri, Feb 09, 2018 at 04:00 AM ~ 6:00 PM

### The best work space I ever been to
 > It was the place where the inside was the best among the companies which visited so far. It seems that the idea of ​​building a space inspired by the home of a good Air Bnbi host in each country is great. If you graduate later and get support from the company, you want to be a top priority.

## REVIEW

        <dd>Google is the best company I ever have been to. Facilities, employees, restaurant, and bike.. just everything was perfect. Google tries to make best working environment for employees and doesn’t spare money for them. I think that’s why the Google is the best company. I want to visit here again as a googler! :)

        <dd>Fantastic! Awesome! Everything was perfect. It was like a big village. Freedom came from the clothes of the employees. If I were an employee, I could not find a reason to leave the company. I love David.

        <dd>Google was my dream company, and I used to hear about their campus facilities. It was more good as I expected! Huge thanks to David for allow us to tour all over the campus and kindly guide us!

        <dd>There is a village where only great people live. Outside of campus is awesome and lifestyle of employees is perfect! I really wanna make a company like Google for my employees.
