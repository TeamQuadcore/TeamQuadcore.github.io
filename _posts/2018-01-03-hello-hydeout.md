We just started our rocket engine here! ;)

Team Quadcore just launched our team blog.

We will post about four categories here: MVP Bootcamp, Tech talk, SV experience, Career advancement.

The theme of this blog is **[Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout)**. Hydeout updates the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 3.x and adds new functionality.

Look forward to our future activities!
