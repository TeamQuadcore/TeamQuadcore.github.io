***Innovation comes when I think about the problem I want to solve.***    
***The One Thing That Never Changes is Change!***    

# Q1.

Is it essential for you to work in the US?

> Ryu : Employment in the United States is much more favorable for masters and doctorates. This is because they really want an expert here.
Soo : The bachelor is not disadvantageous.. The Master's advantage is that he has studied the field further. Drs can rather narrow their capabilities.

# Q2.

Does not anyone make a decision in Silicon Valley?

> Rather than making a decision, they help us.

# Q3.

How can the corporate culture of our country change to the era of innovation?


> The distribution of the decision must be made above. Large companies themselves have to collapse or start up a lot.


# Q4.

Is it meaningless to work hard?


> In the United States, it is important to do well in the end.


# Q5.

What is your mission?

> Innovations in US real estate payment systems using block chains


# Q6.

What do you mean that a company is constant and change is variable?

> Companies in Korea should not be destroyed. You have to adapt to change. Change is natural in Silicon Valley. The company is a variable that is lost and created. The only constant is change.

# Q7.

I think the government's policy hinders the development of Silicon Valley. What do you think about this?


> In fact, what the government takes is not a big blow to Silicon Valley. Money is a virtuous cycle because the market economy is activated differently from Korea.
