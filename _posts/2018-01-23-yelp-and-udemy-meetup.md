        <dd>I was expected about this meet-up, but it was really hard to understand their speech. I decided to improve my listening skill……

        <dd>It was the best experience I have had in the United States. It took longer than I thought to ride a bicycle. But I could see the magnificent view and the big Golden Gate Bridge. It was really really great.

        <dd>It was like imagination. View over the bridge, lovely houses in Sausalito… Literally best experience I ever had in San Francisco. Period.

        <dd>I can be sure that this experience is one of the best experiences I've had in a month. I was so surprised to actually see the Golden Gate, which I was only seeing in pictures. The scenery around Sausalito and Golden Gate could not be photographed. What can i did is bringing everything in my heart.
