### Tour Dream Company, Google.
 > David is a UX designer in Google and we met at Tech-Talk. He invited us to Google plex, so I visited the Google head office and ate a delicious lunch. We visit 3 different restaurant (food truck, asian noodle restaurant, main restaurant), we were really full, but can’t stop eating..! There are fitness club, cafe, restaurants, bikes, zip-car, and even massage center. Employees in Google can concentrate on work completely, that’s why Google has best engineers.

        <dd>Google is the best company I ever have been to. Facilities, employees, restaurant, and bike.. just everything was perfect. Google tries to make best working environment for employees and doesn’t spare money for them. I think that’s why the Google is the best company. I want to visit here again as a googler! :)

        <dd>Fantastic! Awesome! Everything was perfect. It was like a big village. Freedom came from the clothes of the employees. If I were an employee, I could not find a reason to leave the company. I love David.

        <dd>Google was my dream company, and I used to hear about their campus facilities. It was more good as I expected! Huge thanks to David for allow us to tour all over the campus and kindly guide us!
