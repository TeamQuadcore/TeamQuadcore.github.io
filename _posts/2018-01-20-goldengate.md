### Bike tour From Fisherman’s Wharf to Sausalito 
 > This is the thing that you must do in SF. Weather, wind, view, and Golden gate bridge was just perfect. It’s the one you can experience only in Sausalito. The night view of San Francisco from Sausalito was also beautiful. I strongly recommend this!

## Tips
> * Restaurant : Napa Valley Burger Company
* Bike rental fee : $32 (Online Reservations Receive 20% Off => $25 )
* [Refer this link to book bike](https://baycitybike.com/)
* Ferry ticket : $12 
* From Sausalito to Sanfrancisco, you should buy a ticket first, and line up about an hour before you can get on. Waiting line is really long, if you don’t you couldn’t ride a ferry.

## REVIEW

        <dd>While riding a bicycle and listening to music, my thoughts are organized. I will never forget the moment when I cross the Golden Gate Bridge while looking at the Pacific Ocean. It can not be explained. Best Experience in SF.

        <dd>It was the best experience I have had in the United States. It took longer than I thought to ride a bicycle. But I could see the magnificent view and the big Golden Gate Bridge. It was really really great.

        <dd>It was like imagination. View over the bridge, lovely houses in Sausalito… Literally best experience I ever had in San Francisco. Period.

        <dd>I can be sure that this experience is one of the best experiences I've had in a month. I was so surprised to actually see the Golden Gate, which I was only seeing in pictures. The scenery around Sausalito and Golden Gate could not be photographed. What can i did is bringing everything in my heart.
