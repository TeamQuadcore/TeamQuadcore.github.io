        <dd> “This is Yosemite.” That’s real. That was Yosemite. I can’t express the magnificent of nature. I was overwhelmed by scale and beauty of Yosemite. I truly recommend this tour if you are planning to visit SF.

        <dd>How can I express it in text? In front of Mother Nature, I was so small and small. I remember this phrase most memorably. “This is Yosemite!”
