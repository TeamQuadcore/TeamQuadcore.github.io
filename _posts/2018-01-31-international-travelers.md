### Good chance to communicate with foreigners
 > “ There's a pub crawl run by volunteers at hostels in SF so that there's a place for backpackers and locals to meet each other. The event gets a bunch of travelers from all over the city along with locals. Come join us, have some drinks, and meet some new peeps. We do a weekly rock-paper-scissors tournament pub crawl on Wednesdays. Everyone competes while moving from bar-to-bar so that it's easy to meet new people. Winner of the tournament gets a bar tab. We mainly get about 50-60 backpackers who are staying at hostels around the city. “


### Do you want to make new friends?
 > I can learn a lot of software related seminars, but I recommend going to various social meet ups because you can network with other people and get a chance to communicate in English. It was a really fun time, and it seems to be a good place to make foreign friends.

        <dd>Real networking time! I made some friends and also be a linkedIn friend. One of them is  working in Visa as a web app developer and others are data analyst in synopsys. We did rock-scissor-paper game and many conversations. Really good time to know each other and practice English!
