# Q1.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of having to leave the company so fast that you have not worked in the company for more than three years?

> There are many advantages to learning and not tired.
Disadvantages are difficulties in promotion, and it takes a lot of energy to turnover.
In Google, it's good to encourage other hobbies.

# Q2.

In developing process, which experience is the most severe conflict experience? And why?

> Clashes occur every hour almost every day.
Documentation about collisions is important.
The smarter the person, the more frequent the conflict.
I try to find a solution by creating a prototype and showing it.

# Q3.

In the case of software engineer, there is a standardized form of Interview. For the UX designer, how does interview work?

> There is a separate UX recuriter. They mainly look at resume and portfolio. Once the resume passes, you will conduct a telephone interview with the designers. They see if your project is true or not, and they also take a design test. Ask about what you did best in one project.

# Q4.

If there is an engineer interested in UX/UI, what should he prepare to become a designer?

Focus on what you do best.


# Q5.

UX also seems to be able to discuss successes and failures. How can you define failures in UX?

> Failure without learning is failure.

# Q6.

I would like to hear about David Lee's prototype design method, which is one of the best prototypes. Also, each method is important, but what do you usually use the most?

> I think about how you can get a pass without doing the most work. Anyway, what I made is a one-time thing, so I do not spend much time and proceed with speedy. When I create a prototype and show it to users, I change it if there is an error.

# Q7.

It is written in a letter of recommendation that you are very creative and fresh, so how do you get inspiration for such ideas and how do you envision them?

> I have been trained and practiced for creative and fresh ideas. Believe in yourself. It's a good idea to keep thinking where you are. Whatever you do, you have to be happy. Ask questions about users as prototypes.

# Q8.

What was the difficulty of changing as an UX Designer when you started as a web designer and programmer?

> What people around you do not know.
Acting like an UX designer.
Weak visual.

# Q9.

It is difficult to get recognition from others. Your Linked-in profile is full of praise for you from people who worked with you. What is the secret to becoming a person you want to work with?

> Sincerity and commitment are important.

# Q10.

I think there isnâ€™t any jobs that is as sensitive to user reviews as UX Designer. I'm wondering specifically how you can get user reviews.

> There are ways to pay for reviews and to call users and test them. For exmaple, Internal/External, Onsite/Offsite, Survey/Focus Croup, Usability testing, Forum / Rating Survey.

        <dd>For me, the prototype was a very unfamiliar job. I heard about the best experts in the field, and I felt 'It is a very interesting world'. I wanted to live like him in Silicon Valley later on. I will study in my heart with the words that failure without learning is failure.</dd>
