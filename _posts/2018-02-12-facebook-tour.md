## REVIEW

        <dd>Facebook looks like a theme park. There are so many convenient facilities for employees. Also the working place looks really comfortable and unconstrained. Thanks to  were able to try another valuable experience.

        <dd>I thought there would be no more beautiful company than Google. But it was mistaken. If Google was like a village, Facebook was like a theme park. Thanks to the perfect man Lucas.

        <dd>Such a great campus! It was like a village! Super-long office and rooftop garden makes me to want to work at Facebook. Thanks to Lucas for allow us to tour around Facebook and kindly guide us!

        <dd>If Airbnb was the most beautiful inside, Facebook was the best outside. It caused the illusion that I came to the theme park. Cheon was kind enough to guide us, and everything I ate was so delicious.
