- We eat In-N-OUT burger in youtube.

### We visited Youtube with 4 mentors and we took a look at the inside.
 >Donghyun Kim Mentor and Soohyun Lee Mentor showed how to collaborate with git in conference room. We learned how to use it by typing commands. Jeongeun Kim Mentor explained what PRD(program requirements document) is, both were really good time. Each of students conducted HR interviews in English while holding a meeting about team products. It was a good time to experience indirectly HR interviews in Silicon Valley, USA.

## REVIEW

 <dd>"It was really memorable moment. The second floor of Youtube was for UX designer and it looks really comfortable for work. In the dream office, I did also HR interview with Ethan Kim. I was so touched just I was there with google engineer. I am so grateful to the mentors for making this opportunity possible."</dd>

 <dd>"It was my dream office, and I was totally mind-blown. A cool office with a different and light atmosphere than Korea was enough to make me fascinate. The feeling I felt for that day will be remembered forever."</dd>

 <dd>"It was much more amazing place than I imagined. I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere of a completely different office from the office full of partitions. I got the feeling that something was boiling in my mind!!!"</dd>
