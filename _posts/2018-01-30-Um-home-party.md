## REVIEW

        <dd>Soooooo nice food! Teahoon mentor is a really great chef. We had a wonderful time at his house with Donghyun and Soohyun mentor. They told about company culture of google and youtube and emphasized about leetcode. Today’s lesson : ‘Leetcode code is the best.’

        <dd>The world seems unfair. He is perfect. I did not know he would cook well. I had a deep conversation with the mentors. It was really helpful. Later, I thought that I would like to be a person who enjoys this culture with these people.

        <dd>Mentor Taehoon has amazing skill to making some food! I had very long and valuable talk with mentors. They tell us about some important things to get a job in here. Delicious wine did nice support for that talk :)
