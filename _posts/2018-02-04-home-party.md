### Move to New House & Happy Time With Mentors
> It’s time to say good-bye to our first house west crystal cove terrace:(. We move to Daly city and live for 3 weeks. There is a Kukje market near our house, and it sells korean foods! 
New House, New Start!

        <dd>We moved to Daly city, so we invited mentors to new house. We prepare a lot of Korean dishes :). Every moment with mentors is valuable and fun. I’m so sad that only 2 weeks left..

        <dd> It was a good experience to invite mentors to come home, eat food together and watch the Super Bowl. It is always fun to spend time with mentors :)

        <dd> It was our last party moment of that house. I was little sad for leaving this house but I was happy after I heard about Korean market nearby our new house ;)

        <dd>Although it was not enough to express gratitude to mentors, it was a delicious dinner and i was happy. Ethan has served 4 bowls. I am most pleased with this.
