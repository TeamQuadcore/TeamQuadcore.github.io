## The beginning of Idea Pitch
 It was so excited just to listen. We couldn't believe we have a chance to make a presentation to the developers at the best companies. We received a list of companies that we could present ideas. 

### Companies
 * Google Maps
 * Google NBU(Next Billion Users)
 * Youtube
 * Facebook

We thought a lot about selecting a company. All companies have a clear direction and high scalability. In the end, we chose **YouTube**, which we use often and the user's inconvenience was relatively clear.

## Planning
 * 1st week(1.2~1.6)   : Survey of each of the four companies
 * 2nd week(1.8~1.12)  : Select a company
 * 3nd week(1.15~1.19) : Derive Ideas
 * 4th week(1.22~1.26) : Refine ideas
 * 5th week(1.29~2.2)  : User market research (questionnaire, interview)
 * 6th week(2.5~2.9)   : Make Prototype
 * 7th week(2.12~2.14) : Presentation

## Many meetings

We had one or two weekly meetings. We think it is most important to conceive ideas, so the first month was only for meetings.
Initially, the meeting was about whether to present ideas for resolving the inconvenience of YouTube users, or for adding new features. 

### New Feature

But, resolving the inconvenience is too hard and we thought Youtube had already tried a lot. 
We focused on finding new feature. After many meetings, we could derive that our common need is convenient sharing. So, we suggested **YouTube Group**

Previous sharing is done by passing the Url to the SNS when sharing the video. We thought it would be easy to create a Group on YouTube. If one member share a video, the rest can watch it in a group playlist.

Special feature is that you can add applications to shared videos within a group, not just a simple share.
For example, If you are watching a study video, you can add applications like Google Docs. Then you will see the video on the left and Docs on the right. And next time another member of the same group watches the video, he can see the lecture notes one member has written.

belows are our meeting documents until now.

## User Research
In 5th week, we did Youtube user research. First, we sent questionnaires to team member's friends. A total 117 people participated in this survey. Next, we went to Westfield and wework offices for user research. 

We did not know what to do at first, but people were kinder than we thought, so once we started, we could easily go on.
A total 20 people accepted our servey. It was very exciting experience!! It would have been better if there was more time.

## Presentation in YouTube(10.Feb 2018)
Finally, the day had to come!
We went to YouTube and showed our efforts until now. Presentation time was 20 minutes composed of pitch 15 minutes and prototype 5 minutes. 

The team was very nervous because it was done in front of current developers, but the announcement was pretty well done.
The mentors' questions were too sharp and pointed out areas we had not thought of before. After completing the difficult questions, a big applause and laughter burst out in the hall, and our team was able to smile.

## REVIEW
<dl>
    <dt>Seungwoo Jeong</dt>
        <dd>It was a moment when I thought about when I could try this experience in my life. 
It was so exciting before the presentation, and there was a lot of regret after the presentation was over. I was not able to answer the questions of the mentor's sharp questions, but I thought that I could turn the answer of the question into a better idea. It was a precious experience and it was an unforgettable memory. Thank you so much to my team members also!</dd>

        <dd>It was a dream come true to be able to suggest our team's ideas directly to YouTube. It seems to have learned various things. Based on the advice of mentors, we would like to develop our ideas and apply them to YouTube. Thank you to the mentors who listened earnestly and asked sharp questions.</dd>

        <dd>It was great experience for pitching our own idea in front of YouTube staff engineer! Whether our product is worth to YouTube, mentors were so kind for feeding some suggetions back to us. Thanks to mentors for listening our speech!</dd>

        <dd>As an idea pitch leader, I was very much burdened and worried. But our team did well and I am very proud. The process of drawing ideas was so much fun, and it was so excited to go out and do the research. I made the prototype for the first time, I was surprised to see myself doing better than I thought, and I thought that this area is very interesting. Presentation in English was the most difficult. I think I could have made a better presentation. I am very grateful to the mentors who made this opportunity.</dd>
