### Everyone was excited to go into Google, the dream company.
 > The inside of company was really clean and has various facilities. Googlers don’t have to go out for something, everything can be solved in Google. There, we did one by one coding interview with Donghyun mentor and Soohyun mentor. It was really really precious memory for us.

## What is important in coding interview?
> * Calculate time complexity and find the optimistic algorithm using data structure!
* Don’t try to find at once, Think step by step

## REVIEW

        <dd>View of bay bridge in Google was fantastic and inside of the company was really nice. I can’t believe that I did coding interview with Ethan mentor in Google. After the coding interview, I felt It is important not to solve the problem and find answer, but to think about the algorithm and what kind of data structure to use when calculating the time complexity. Also I had a one on one talk with my mentor, Jungeun. She looked at resume for Google UX/UI designer internship and gave some advice on how to fix it.

        <dd>The experience of seeing a coding interview at Google in a dream job was fantastic. It was great to feel the free atmosphere of Google alone. The scenery was also good, so I felt my mind clear. I realized that simply solving the problem is not the end, but that I have to approach it in various ways. It was a lot of personal day.

        <dd>It was a great opportunity to enjoy working in a fantastic view. I was surprised at the good work environment where inspiration emerges even if I stayed still, and I wanted to work here. The coding interview was a really good experience, and I realized once again that there is still a long way to go.
