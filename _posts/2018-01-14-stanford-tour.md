### Where
- Stanford, CA

### When
- Sun, Jan 14, 2018 at 10:30 AM ~ 8:30 PM

###  We went to Stanford on the Caltrain,
 > and had lunch at Curry house (recommended by Donghyun mentor). After lunch we drank mint mojito of philz coffee and that was really unique and nice. We walked around Stanford campus and saw Rodinâ€™s collection.


## Our Route
`Curry up now > Philz coffee > Stanford University > Stanford shopping center`

## Tips
> Restaurant : Curry up now
Caltrain has to take a card when you get off. 
Dispense interval is really long, so you should check.

        <dd>Campus was really huge!! Rodin collection and other work of art was fantastic. The most amazing thing was companies & government agencies in Job Fair for engineering. It includes YOUTUBE, MICROSOFT, DROPBOX, and IBM. I want to enter Stanford~~~

        <dd>Above all, I was really surprised at the size of a big university. I felt that this was the best university in the world. Originally, I was not interested in art, but the works I saw on rodin were fantastic. The weather was even better and I was happier.

        <dd>Stanford has many fascinating things! Huge campus, shopping center, and Cantor Art Center! Watching rodin collection was wonderful experience to me. Nice weather and nice coffee (Mint Mojito, from Philz!) makes me happy ;)

        <dd>It is not good to compare, but I was overwhelmed by the size and atmosphere of Stanford, which is so different from my school. I felt something new dream is blooming in me!
