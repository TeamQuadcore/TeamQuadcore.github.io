      <h2 id="the-beginning-of-idea-pitch">The beginning of Idea Pitch</h2>
<p>It was so excited just to listen. We couldn’t believe we have a chance to make a presentation to the developers at the best companies. We received a list of companies that we could present ideas.</p>

<h3 id="companies">Companies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Google Maps</li>
  <li>Google NBU(Next Billion Users)</li>
  <li>Youtube</li>
  <li>Facebook</li>
</ul>

<p>We thought a lot about selecting a company. All companies have a clear direction and high scalability. In the end, we chose <strong>YouTube</strong>, which we use often and the user’s inconvenience was relatively clear.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1st week(1.2~1.6)   : Survey of each of the four companies</li>
  <li>2nd week(1.8~1.12)  : Select a company</li>
  <li>3nd week(1.15~1.19) : Derive Ideas</li>
  <li>4th week(1.22~1.26) : Refine ideas</li>
  <li>5th week(1.29~2.2)  : User market research (questionnaire, interview)</li>
  <li>6th week(2.5~2.9)   : Make Prototype</li>
  <li>7th week(2.12~2.14) : Presentation</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="many-meetings">Many meetings</h2>

<p>We had one or two weekly meetings. We think it is most important to conceive ideas, so the first month was only for meetings.
Initially, the meeting was about whether to present ideas for resolving the inconvenience of YouTube users, or for adding new features.</p>

<h3 id="new-feature">New Feature</h3>

<p>But, resolving the inconvenience is too hard and we thought Youtube had already tried a lot. 
We focused on finding new feature. After many meetings, we could derive that our common need is convenient sharing. So, we suggested <strong>YouTube Group</strong></p>

<p>Previous sharing is done by passing the Url to the SNS when sharing the video. We thought it would be easy to create a Group on YouTube. If one member share a video, the rest can watch it in a group playlist.</p>

<p>Special feature is that you can add applications to shared videos within a group, not just a simple share.
For example, If you are watching a study video, you can add applications like Google Docs. Then you will see the video on the left and Docs on the right. And next time another member of the same group watches the video, he can see the lecture notes one member has written.</p>

<p>belows are our meeting documents until now.</p>

<h2 id="user-research">User Research</h2>
<p>In 5th week, we did Youtube user research. First, we sent questionnaires to team member’s friends. A total 117 people participated in this survey. Next, we went to Westfield and wework offices for user research.</p>

<p>We did not know what to do at first, but people were kinder than we thought, so once we started, we could easily go on.
A total 20 people accepted our servey. It was very exciting experience!! It would have been better if there was more time.</p>

<h2 id="prototypedesigned-by-hyeonggeun">Prototype(designed by Hyeonggeun)</h2>
<p>Create a group. We have 3 methods to invite members</p>
<ul>
  <li>Input member’s google account
<img src="/assets/img/Prototype1.png" alt="title" /></li>
  <li>Connecting with Google Group
<img src="/assets/img/Prototype2.png" alt="title" /></li>
  <li>Sharing invitation link

</ul>

<p>Initial screen when first created group

<p>If many members share their videos, Playlist can be expanded. (Categories are created automatically by YouTube’s classfication)
<img src="/assets/img/Prototype5.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>You can even watch food videos and share recipes using Google Docs.
<img src="/assets/img/Prototype6.png" alt="title" /></p>

<p>Video with applied application has applied app’s icons beside title.

<p>For travel videos, you can mark group’s Google Map and post comments to share your experiences with group members.

<h2 id="presentation-in-youtube10feb-2018">Presentation in YouTube(10.Feb 2018)</h2>
<p>Finally, the day had to come!
We went to YouTube and showed our efforts until now. Presentation time was 20 minutes composed of pitch 15 minutes and prototype 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The team was very nervous because it was done in front of current developers, but the announcement was pretty well done.
The mentors’ questions were too sharp and pointed out areas we had not thought of before. After completing the difficult questions, a big applause and laughter burst out in the hall, and our team was able to smile.</p>

        <dd>It was a moment when I thought about when I could try this experience in my life. 
It was so exciting before the presentation, and there was a lot of regret after the presentation was over. I was not able to answer the questions of the mentor's sharp questions, but I thought that I could turn the answer of the question into a better idea. It was a precious experience and it was an unforgettable memory. Thank you so much to my team members also!</dd>
    <dt>Minjun Cha</dt>
        <dd>It was a dream come true to be able to suggest our team's ideas directly to YouTube. It seems to have learned various things. Based on the advice of mentors, we would like to develop our ideas and apply them to YouTube. Thank you to the mentors who listened earnestly and asked sharp questions.</dd>
    <dt>Seunghwan Hong</dt>
        <dd>It was great experience for pitching our own idea in front of YouTube staff engineer! Whether our product is worth to YouTube, mentors were so kind for feeding some suggetions back to us. Thanks to mentors for listening our speech!</dd>
    <dt>Hyeonggeun Eom</dt>
        <dd>As an idea pitch leader, I was very much burdened and worried. But our team did well and I am very proud. The process of drawing ideas was so much fun, and it was so excited to go out and do the research. I made the prototype for the first time, I was surprised to see myself doing better than I thought, and I thought that this area is very interesting. Presentation in English was the most difficult. I think I could have made a better presentation. I am very grateful to the mentors who made this opportunity.</dd>

<p>Unlike other companies in Silicon Valley, Uber has been told that there is discriminatory treatment for women. Basically, in a company with such a perception, is it necessary for a female engineer to survive in a company other than a skillful one?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that CEOs should consider equal culture. Uber CEO did not. In fact, it is the driving force of Uber’s success. Now, such a trend is changing a lot.</p>

If you can not do it in Korea, you will get soul on the spot and release it later.
If you do not do it in the US, you will lose your job and give it to someone else.</p>

<p>One of the corporate cultures on Facebook is that they often change teams. What do you think about the pros and cons of this culture?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Facebook, it’s important to make the product fast. Anyone should be able to do something else tomorrow. There is an opportunity to learn about what to do with the team to move. There is a learning center in the company, and it is the culture that learns while helping each other in the team.</p>

<p>What is the difference between American and Korean welfare?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the US, company support a variety of things inside the company, so we can not go out of the company.
It is not easy to turnover in Korea, so the company does not put much effort into the welfare.</p>

        <dd>It was good time to hear various company culture, and differences between Korean and US company style.</dd>
    <dt>Minjun Cha</dt>
        <dd>It was an interesting interview.
        Where can I hear about corporate culture?
        Even IBM, Uber, Facebook ... it was significant.
        It was exciting to hear about the culture of each company in detail. The current job is to show you the results in five years, and you're asking me to catch the goal five years later, and I'll be studying in Silicon Valley five years later!</dd>
    <dt>Seunghwan Hong</dt>
        <dd>It was good experience to listening Silicon Valley’s overall culture, especially Facebook’s. Now I’m eager to find job in here :)</dd>

        <dd>He is the one who lives the life I want to live. He was the first person to go the way I wanted to go, so I had a lot of questions and time was short.</dd>

  <p>This is the thing that you must do in SF. Weather, wind, view, and Golden gate bridge was just perfect. It’s the one you can experience only in Sausalito. The night view of San Francisco from Sausalito was also beautiful. I strongly recommend this!</p>

        <dd>While riding a bicycle and listening to music, my thoughts are organized. I will never forget the moment when I cross the Golden Gate Bridge while looking at the Pacific Ocean. It can not be explained. Best Experience in SF.
    </dd>
    <dt>Minjun Cha</dt>
        <dd>It was the best experience I have had in the United States. It took longer than I thought to ride a bicycle. But I could see the magnificent view and the big Golden Gate Bridge. It was really really great.
        </dd>
    <dt>Seunghwan Hong</dt>
        <dd>It was like imagination. View over the bridge, lovely houses in Sausalito… Literally best experience I ever had in San Francisco. Period.
        </dd>
    <dt>Hyeonggeun Eom</dt>
        <dd>I can be sure that this experience is one of the best experiences I've had in a month. I was so surprised to actually see the Golden Gate, which I was only seeing in pictures. The scenery around Sausalito and Golden Gate could not be photographed. What can i did is bringing everything in my heart.

  <p>What is the front end, and how does it compare to the back end? What is the client-server model, and why is this important? What are APIs, why are they important, and how do I make an API call? What is JSON, how do I use it, and why is it important? How computers communicate over the web, using the request response paradigm. How do I get started working on my own web app?
