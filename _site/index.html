        <dd>Even though I’m already familiar with git &amp; terminal command, it was a nice opportunity to truly perfect the work flow with git. Not much hard to understand I could learn easily. First meet-up was perfect! I really expect the rest of meet-up.

<p>In Korea, Google Internship Recruit Program is now in progress. How is the recruitment of full-time employees after internships judged in major company like Google or IBM?</p>

Generally, conversion rate is 60% ~ 70%, so internships can be easy way to hire.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="q3">Q3.</h1>

<p>After graduating from a Korean university, please let me know step by step what you have prepared to join a company in Silicon Valley.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It began with a curiosity about the United States. I left my studies and went to PhD, but research did not fit my aptitude. I was interested in making service, so I dropped out and get a job. It would have been easier if I knew there was a way I could apply in Korea.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="q4">Q4.</h1>

<p>Do major companies prefer full-stack engineers? Or prefer experts in one technical field?</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>We visit it and taste some local food. After having lunch at Ziggy’s burger, we went to Coi tower and could see golden bridge &amp; alcatraz because of the weather.

        <dd>We was supposed to go meet-up , but most attendees are 50-60s. So we decide to hang out by ourselves. It was great choice. We walked and went around from Ferry building to Union Square, the distance was really long, but I felt so good cause I always sit and do Mvp project. It was good to refresh my mind!
    </dd>
    <dt>Minjun Cha</dt>
        <dd>was worried about the rain coming but the weather was very nice. We saw many local market in Ferry Building and experienced their atmosphere. Coi tower was very grand. It was hard to get there because it was too high. But it was nice experience. China town was an environment that made me misunderstand that I an in America. But I do not want to go again….
    </dd>
    <dt>Seunghwan Hong</dt>
        <dd>Ferry Building was more beautiful as I expected. Nice weather and delicious food perfectly supported my nice day. Also Coi Tower was enough to capture my mind. It was very hard journey, but It was good to me for organizing my thoughts. It was nice day!</dd>
    <dt>Hyeonggeun Eom</dt>
        <dd>The beach near the Ferry Building was really good. The weather was good and everything was perfect! The road from Ferry Building to Coi tower was extremly high and difficult. But, the landscape of arriving made me think that i didn’t waste my sweat.</dd>

<h3 id="we-visited-youtube-with-4-mentors-and-we-took-a-look-at-the-inside">We visited Youtube with 4 mentors and we took a look at the inside.</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Donghyun Kim Mentor and Soohyun Lee Mentor showed how to collaborate with git in conference room. We learned how to use it by typing commands. Jeongeun Kim Mentor explained what PRD(program requirements document) is, both were really good time. Each of students conducted HR interviews in English while holding a meeting about team products. It was a good time to experience indirectly HR interviews in Silicon Valley, USA.</p>

 <dd>"It was really memorable moment. The second floor of Youtube was for UX designer and it looks really comfortable for work. In the dream office, I did also HR interview with Ethan Kim. I was so touched just I was there with google engineer. I am so grateful to the mentors for making this opportunity possible."</dd>

 <dt>Minjun Cha</dt>  
 <dd>"First, I fascinated fantastic work space. Having a meeting in the YouTube meeting room was a very valuable experience. I really wanted to work. Also In and Out burger was very delicious hahahaha."</dd>

 <dt>Seunghwan Hong</dt>
 <dd>"It was my dream office, and I was totally mind-blown. A cool office with a different and light atmosphere than Korea was enough to make me fascinate. The feeling I felt for that day will be remembered forever."</dd>

 <dt>Hyeonggeun Eom</dt> 
 <dd>"It was much more amazing place than I imagined. I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere of a completely different office from the office full of partitions. I got the feeling that something was boiling in my mind!!!"</dd>
